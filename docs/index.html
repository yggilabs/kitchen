<h1>Kitchen</h1>
<p>Under Construction<. I have put a couple placeholders to try to work out what needs to be written up/p>
<h2>Meals</h2>

Meals are an example of what would be included with each parcel. The recipes would be for internal use.

<ul>
{% for meal in site.meals %}
  <li><a href="{{ meal.url | prepend: site.github.baseurl }}">{{ meal.title | replace: "_", " " }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
